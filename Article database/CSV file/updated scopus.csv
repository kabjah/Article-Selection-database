However, it is difficult to accurately and robustly segment lung nodules attached to the chest wall or with ground-glass opacities using conventional image processing methods. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a method for robust and accurate three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of lung nodule regions using deep learning. In this study, a nested 3D fully connected convolutional network with residual unit structures was proposed, and designed a new loss function. Compared with annotated images obtained under the guidance of a radiologist, the Dice similarity coefficient (DS) and intersection over union (IoU) were 0.845 ± 0.008 and 0.738 ± 0.011, respectively, for 332 lung nodules (lung adenocarcinoma) obtained from 332 patients. On the other hand, for 3D U-Net and 3D SegNet, the DS was 0.822 ± 0.009 and 0.786 ± 0.011, respectively, and the IoU was 0.711 ± 0.011 and 0.660 ± 0.012, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method is significantly superior to well-known deep learning models. Moreover, we compared the results obtained from the proposed method with those obtained from conventional image processing methods, watersheds, and graph cuts. The DS and IoU results for the watershed method were 0.628 ± 0.027 and 0.494 ± 0.025, respectively, and those for the graph cut method were 0.566 ± 0.025 and 0.414 ± 0.021, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method is significantly superior to conventional image processing methods. The proposed method may be useful for accurate and robust segmentation of lung nodules to assist radiologists in the diagnosis of lung nodules such as lung adenocarcinoma on CT images.

Computed tomography (CT) is an effective and economical lung cancer detection method. In CT images, the size and shape of pulmonary nodules appear different, and some nodules appear similar to the surrounding tissues. Therefore, the automatic localization of pulmonary nodules in CT images is a challenging task. An attention-embedded three-dimensional convolutional neural network is proposed for pulmonary nodule detection in the current study. Specifically, 1) channel-spatial attention guides 3D ResNet to down sample the input 3D CT patch. The channel pays attention to important features and the space to the region of interest. The two form a complementary feature extraction mechanism to effectively help the global flow of information in the network and refine the feature mapping to extract the nodule context features. 2) The channel-spatial attention module changes the fusion model of the feature pyramid, adaptively adjusts the pixel-level weight between features and extracts multi-scale representative node features. 3) The deep separable convolution is used to replace the standard convolution of ResNet, reducing the time cost and improving the efficiency of model training on the premise of ensuring the model's performance. 4) To adapt the distribution of nodule scale, different characteristic layers correspond to two sizes of anchors. Under the condition of ensuring the detection rate of nodules, the number of anchor frames is reduced, and the network sensitivity is improved. Finally, several ablation experiments are carried out using the LUNA16 dataset. The results revealed that the attention-guided network could extract the multi-scale representative features of nodules, and the average sensitivity was 97.7%. Additionally, the CMP score reached 0.912. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve the detection sensitivity and control the number of false positive nodules, which has clinical application value and a certain reference value. © 2013 IEEE.",Channel-spatial attention mechanism; computed tomography scan; medical computer vision; multi-scale features; pulmonary nodule,Biological organs; Computer vision; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Three dimensional displays; Adaptation models; Attention mechanisms; Channel-spatial attention mechanism; Computed tomography; Computed tomography scan; Features extraction; Lung; Lung Cancer; Medical computer vision; Multi-scale features; Pulmonary nodules; Spatial attention; Three-dimensional display; Feature extraction,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132683699

An algorithm is proposed for 3D CT sequence images in this paper based on 3D Res U-Net segmentation network and 3D ResNet50 classification network. The common convolutional layers in encoding and decoding paths of U-Net are replaced by residual units while the loss function is changed to Dice loss after using cross entropy loss to accelerate network convergence. Since the lung nodules are small and rich in 3D information, the ResNet50 is improved by replacing the 2D convolutional layers with 3D convolutional layers and reducing the sizes of some convolution kernels, 3D ResNet50 network is obtained for the diagnosis of benign and malignant lung nodules. Results: 3D Res U-Net was trained and tested on 1044 CT subcases in the LIDC-IDRI database. The segmentation result shows that the Dice coefficient of 3D Res U-Net is above 0.8 for the segmentation of lung nodules larger than 10 mm in diameter. 3D ResNet50 was trained and tested on 2960 lung nodules in the LIDC-IDRI database. The classification result shows that the diagnostic accuracy of 3D ResNet50 is 87.3% and AUC is 0.907. Conclusion: The 3D Res U-Net module improves segmentation performance significantly with the comparison of 3D U-Net model based on residual learning mechanism. 3D Res U-Net can identify small nodules more effectively and improve its segmentation accuracy for large nodules. Compared with the original network, the classification performance of 3D ResNet50 is significantly improved, especially for small benign nodules. © 2021, The Author(s).",Convolutional neural network; Image classification; Image segmentation; Lung nodule; Residual learning; U-Net,"3D modeling; Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Image segmentation; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Images segmentations; Important value; Lung nodule; Lung nodule segmentation; Recognition algorithm; Residual learning; Segmentation algorithms; U-net; Convolution; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; human; image processing; lung; lung tumor; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Neural Networks, Computer; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118706516

Most state-of-the-art lung nodule detection models are based on Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) due to its superior performance. However, this object detection approach faces difficulties with the variety of nodule sizes in training datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system based on Faster R-CNN model with adaptive anchor box for lung nodule detection. Our method employs ground-truth nodule sizes in the training dataset to generate adaptive anchor box sizes of Faster R-CNN. Learned anchors are used as hyper-parameter to boost Faster R-CNN's detection performance. A residual convolutional neural network is proposed to reduce false positives from Faster R-CNN's output. Our method is trained and tested on the largest publicly available LUNA16 dataset. Experiments show that our proposed system achieves a high sensitivity of 95.64% at 1.72 false positives per scan, and a Competition Performance Metric (CPM) score of 88.2%, which outperforms other recent state-of-the-art detection methods. The false positive reduction network achieves a sensitivity of 93.8%, specificity of 97.6% and accuracy of 95.7%. An additional evaluation on a completely independent SPIE-AAPM dataset demonstrates the generalization of our proposed model with 89.3% sensitivity. © 2013 IEEE.",anchor box; CT~images; deep learning; faster R-CNN; Pulmonary nodules,Biological organs; Convolution; Deep learning; Diseases; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Three dimensional displays; Anchor-box; Convolutional neural network; CT Image; Deep learning; Fast region-based convolutional neural network; Features extraction; Lung Cancer; Proposal; Pulmonary nodules; Region-based; Sensitivity; Three-dimensional display; Computerized tomography,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120043277

This chronic disease causes difficulty in breathing which can lead to lung cancer. The progressive destruction of emphysema can be assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) scans and pulmonary function tests. The severity of the disease may extend to a stage where one can risk their life emphasizing the early detection of emphysema. Primary diagnosis can be done using spirometry and CT for early detection of the disease reducing the mortality rates. Difficulties associated with different diagnostic procedures and inter and intra-observer variations have made blooming researches on more computer-aided techniques. This paper intends to develop a computer-aided technique using the improved deep learning strategy. The initial process is image pre-processing, which is performed by histogram equalization and median filtering. Further, the Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering is used for segmentation. After segmentation, a new Adaptive Local Ternary Pattern (ALTP) is used for extracting the pattern descriptor, which is further utilized for classification. As a new contribution, the Parameter Optimized-Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (PO-FRCNN) is developed for performing the diagnosis. The enhancement of pattern formation and deep classification is accomplished by the Improved Red Deer Algorithm (IRDA), which helps to tune the significant parameters that have a positive influence on the accurateness. The benchmark and real-time dataset are used for performing the experimentation. The results show that the proposed method yields the best result and can effectively diagnose emphysema when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. © 2013 IEEE.",Adaptive local ternary pattern; fuzzy C means clustering; modified deep learning; parameter optimized-faster region convolutional neural network; pulmonary emphysema,Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Fuzzy systems; Adaptive local ternary pattern; Chronic disease; Computer-aided techniques; Convolutional neural network; Disease cause; Fuzzy C-Means clustering; Modified deep learning; Parameter optimized-fast region convolutional neural network; Parameter-optimized; Pulmonary emphysema; Median filters,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117598398

It is reported that more than half of patients with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. Because mediastinal lymph node status is the most important factor for the treatment and prognosis of lung cancer, the aim of this study is to improve the predictive value in assessing the computed tomography (CT) of mediastinal lymph-node malignancy in patients with primary lung cancer. This paper introduces a new method for creating pseudo-labeled images of CT regions of mediastinal lymph nodes by using the concept of recurrence analysis in nonlinear dynamics for the transfer learning. Pseudo-labeled images of original CT images are used as input into deep-learning models. Three popular pretrained convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-201) were used for the implementation of the proposed concept for the classification of benign and malignant mediastinal lymph nodes using a public CT database. In comparison with the use of the original CT data, the results show the high performance of the transformed images for the task of classification. Three pretrained convolutional neural networks that are AlexNet, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet201 were trained and tested with the transformed images. Classification accuracies and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained from the ten-fold cross-validation are 93% and 0.97, 96% and 0.99, and 100% and 1 for the SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and DenseNet201, respectively. The proposed method has the potential for differentiating benign from malignant mediastinal lymph nodes on CT, and may provide a new way for studying lung cancer using radiology imaging. © 2013 IEEE.",computed tomography; convolutional neural networks; Lung cancer; lymph nodes; recurrence analysis; transfer learning,Biological organs; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Transfer learning; Classification accuracy; Cross validation; Labeled images; Learning models; Mediastinal lymph nodes; Predictive values; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Recurrence analysis; Computerized tomography,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110538840

Precision medicine practices have shown advances in the individualized treatment according to the genetic profile of each patient, providing better control on cancer response. Medical imaging offers valuable information with an extensive perspective of the cancer, opening opportunities to explore the imaging manifestations associated with the tumor genotype in a non-invasive way. This work aims to study the relevance of physiological features captured from Computed Tomography images, using three different 2D regions of interest to assess the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status: nodule, lung containing the main nodule, and both lungs. A Convolutional Autoencoder was developed for the reconstruction of the input image. Thereafter, the encoder block was used as a feature extractor, stacking a classifier on top to assess the EGFR mutation status. Results showed that extending the analysis beyond the local nodule allowed the capture of more relevant information, suggesting the presence of useful biomarkers using the lung with nodule region of interest, which allowed to obtain the best prediction ability. This comparative study represents an innovative approach for gene mutations status assessment, contributing to the discussion on the extent of pathological phenomena associated with cancer development, and its contribution to more accurate Artificial Intelligence-based solutions, and constituting, to the best of our knowledge, the first deep learning approach that explores a comprehensive analysis for the EGFR mutation status classification. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional autoencoder; EGFR prediction; lung cancer; transfer learning; unsupervised feature learning,Biological organs; Computerized tomography; D region; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; Transfer learning; Comparative studies; Comprehensive analysis; Computed tomography images; Epidermal growth factor receptors; Imaging manifestations; Innovative approaches; Physiological features; Unsupervised transfer learning; Deep learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103794103

An Energy Layer (EL) is incorporated in our scheme, which extracts texture features from the convolutional layer. The inclusion of EL reduces the number of learnable parameters of the network, which further reduces the memory requirements and computational complexity. The proposed model has only three convolutional layers and one EL, instead of pooling layer. Overall proposed CNN architecture comprises of nine layers for automatic feature extraction and classification of pulmonary nodule candidates as malignant or benign. Furthermore, the pre-trained model of proposed CNN is also used to handle the smaller dataset classification problem by using transfer learning. This work has been evaluated on publicly available LIDC-IDRI and the LUNGx Challenge database through different evaluation matrices, such as; the accuracy, specificity, error rate and AUC. The proposed model is trained by six-fold cross-validation and achieved an accuracy score of 96.69% ± 0.72% with only 3.30% ± 0.72% error rate. Whereas, the measured AUC and recall is 99.11%±0.45% and 97.19%±0.57%, respectively. Moreover, we also tested our proposed technique on the MNIST dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and error rate. © 2021",Cancer detection; CNN; Computed tomography; Computer aided diagnosis; Image classification; LIDC-IDRI; Lung nodule; LUNGx challenge; Machine learning; Transfer learning,Biological organs; Chemical detection; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Deep learning; Diseases; Errors; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Positron emission tomography; Textures; Transfer learning; Automatic feature extraction; Classification performance; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Cross validation; Evaluation matrices; Learning techniques; Memory requirements; Pulmonary nodules; Convolutional neural networks,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101134039

This article proposes a joint lung nodule detection and classification network for simultaneous lung nodule detection, segmentation and classification subject to possible label uncertainty in the training set. It operates in an end-to-end manner and provides detection and classification of nodules simultaneously together with a segmentation of the detected nodules. Both the nodule detection and classification subnetworks of the proposed joint network adopt a 3-D encoder-decoder architecture for better exploration of the 3-D data. Moreover, the classification subnetwork utilizes the features extracted from the detection subnetwork and multiscale nodule-specific features for boosting the classification performance. The former serves as valuable prior information for optimizing the more complicated 3D classification network directly to better distinguish suspicious nodules from other tissues compared with direct backpropagation from the decoder. Experimental results show that this co-training yields better performance on both tasks. The framework is validated on the LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets and a pseudo-label approach is proposed for addressing the label uncertainty problem due to inconsistent annotations/labels. Experimental results show that the proposed nodule detector outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and yields comparable performance as state-of-the-art nodule classification algorithms when classification alone is considered. Since our joint detection/recognition approach can directly detect nodules and classify its malignancy instead of performing the tasks separately, our approach is more practical for automatic cancer and nodules detection. © 2013 IEEE.",Deep learning; label noise; multi-task learning; nodule detection; nodule malignancy classification,Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Data reduction; Decoding; Diseases; Classification algorithm; Classification networks; Classification performance; Computer tomography images; Encoder-decoder architecture; Lung cancer diagnosis; Lung nodule detection; State-of-the-art algorithms; Classification (of information),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099057268

Despite substantial improvement in recent diagnoses and medications, the five year cure ratio is just 19%. Before even the diagnosis, classification of lung nodule is an essential step, particularly because early detection can help doctors with a highly valued opinion. CT image detection and classification is possible easily and accurately with advanced vision devices and machine-learning technology. This field of work has been extremely successful. Researchers have already attempted to improve the accuracy of CAD structures by computational tomography (CT) in the screening of lung cancer in several deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a fully automated lung CT system for lung nodule classification, namely, new transfer method (NTM) which has two parts. First features are extracted by applying different VOI and feature extraction techniques. We used intensity, shape, contrast of border and spicula extraction to extract the lung nodule. Then these nodules are transfer to the classification part where we used advance-fully convolution network (A-FCN) to classify the lung nodule between benign and malignant. Our A-FCN network contain three types of layers that helps to enhance the performance and accuracy of NTM network which are convolution layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer.

Recently, deep learning has provided powerful tools in lung cancer diagnose and therapeutic regimen making. However, it is still a challenge to identify the pathological type of lung cancer in early stage by CT images due to the lack of public training data set and powerful artificial intelligent models. In this work, we firstly build up a data set of CT images from 125 patients of lung cancer in early stage. The data set is enhanced by revolving, shifting and reproducing operations to avoid its inherent imbalance. After that, a deep convolutional neural network namely VGG16-T is proposed and multiple VGG16-T worked as weak classifiers are trained with a boosting strategy. Such method achieves significant performance in identifying pathological type of lung cancer with CT images by joint voting. Experiments conducted on the enhanced data set of CT images show that 3 weak classifiers VGG16-T are sufficient to achieve accuracy 86.58% in identifying pathological type, which performs better than some state-of-the-art deep learning models, including AlexNet, ResNet-34 and DenseNet with or without Softmax weights. As well, VGG16-T is with accuracy 85% by diagnosing 20 randomly selected CT images, while two respiratory doctors from Grade 3A level hospitals obtain accuracy 55% and 65% by handcrafted diagnosing, respectively. To our best acknowledge, this is the first attempt of using deep models and boosting to identify pathological type of lung cancer in early stage from small scale CT images. © 2020 The Authors.

Then, the convolution neural network (CNN) optimized by genetic algorithm and the traditional CNN are used to extract the features of CT image of pulmonary nodules. The corresponding features of different images are automatically distinguished. By comparing the accuracy of the two algorithms, it is proved that the CNN optimized by genetic algorithm has higher accuracy.

Generally, it requires multiple imaging methods to complement each other to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis. In this work, we propose a deep learning model to identify lung cancer type from CT images for patients in Shandong Provincial Hospital. It has a two-fold challenge: artificial intelligent models trained by public datasets cannot meet such practical requires, and the amount of collected patients' data is quite few. To solve the two-fold problem, we use image rotation, translation and transformation methods to expand and balance our training data, and then densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) is used to classify malignant tumor from images collected from, and finally adaptive boosting (adaboost) algorithm is used to aggregate multiple classification results to improve classification performance. Experimental results show that our method can achieve identifying accuracy 89.85%, which performs better than DenseNet without adaboost, ResNet, VGG16 and AlexNet.

Currently, this important task remains challenging for lack of the voxel-level annotation and training strategies that balance target/background voxels in thoracic CT images. In this paper, a new region-based network, called Nodule-plus Region-based CNN, is proposed to detect pulmonary nodules in 3D thoracic CT images effectively while synchronously generating an instance segmentation mask for every detected instance. Our new network is constructed with a stack of convolutional blocks in which lateral connections are used to alleviate the difficulty of vanishing gradients. In addition, in order to reduce annotation workload and make best use of unannotated samples, we proposed a new Deep Self-paced Active Learning (DSAL) strategy by combining Active Learning (AL) and Self-Paced Learning (SPL) strategies. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of our proposed Nodule-plus R-CNN, we conduct a series of experiments on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset, and our model achieves 0.66 Dice and 0.96 TP Dice, which are state-of-the-art best results of pulmonary nodule segmentation.
