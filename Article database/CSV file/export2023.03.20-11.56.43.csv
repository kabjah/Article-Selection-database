Wang,"School of Information Engineering, Pingdingshan University, Pingdingshan, China; School of Information Engineering, Pingdingshan University, Pingdingshan, China; School of Information Engineering, Pingdingshan University, Pingdingshan, China",IEEE Access,18-May-20,2020,8,,86400,86410,"Lung cancer is known to be one of the most dangerous diseases which are the main reason for disease and death when diagnosed in primitive stages. Since lung cancer can only be detected more broadly after it spread to lung parts and the occurrence of lung cancer in the earlier stage is very difficult to predict. It causes a greater risk as radiologists and specialist doctors assess the existence of lung cancer. For this reason, it is important to build a smart and automatic cancer prediction system that is accurate and at which stage of cancer or to improve the accuracy of the previous cancer prediction that will help determines the type of treatment and treatment depth depending on the severity of the disease. In this paper, the Adaptive Hierarchical Heuristic Mathematical Model (AHHMM) has been proposed for the deep learning approach. To analyze deep learning based on the historical therapy scheme in the development of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) automated radiation adaptation protocols that aim at optimizing local tumor regulation at lower rates of grade 2 RP2 radiation pneumonitis. Furthermore, the system proposed consists of several steps including acquiring the image, preprocessing, binarization, thresholding, and segmentation, extraction of features and detection of deep neural network (DNN). Segmentation of the lung CT image is carried out to extract any significant feature of a segmented image, and a specific feature extraction method is implemented.

Hence, the exact locations of lung nodules are a critical and complicated task. Researchers in this area have been working widely for almost two years. However, previous computer-aided detection (CAD) modules, such as transforming CT, segmenting the lung nodule and extracting the features are mostly complex and time-consuming, because more modules will require the creation of a complete image processing system. In addition, certain state-of-the-art deep learning systems are specified in the database standard. For this purpose, this paper suggests an efficient identification system for lung nodules based on Multi-Scene Deep Learning Framework (MSDLF) by the vesselness filter. A four-channel CNN model is designed to enhance the radiologist's knowledge in the detection of four-stage nodules by integrating two image Scenes. This model can be applied in two different classes.

An early detection enhances the survival rate of the patient by starting treatment at the right time. The detection and classification of malignancy in Computed Tomography (CT) images is a very time-consuming and difficult task for radiologists which lead the researchers to develop algorithms for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems to mitigate this burden. The performance of CAD systems is continuously improving by using various deep learning techniques for screening of lung cancer. In this paper, we proposed transferable texture Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to improve the classification performance of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. An Energy Layer (EL) is incorporated in our scheme, which extracts texture features from the convolutional layer. The inclusion of EL reduces the number of learnable parameters of the network, which further reduces the memory requirements and computational complexity. The proposed model has only three convolutional layers and one EL, instead of pooling layer. Overall proposed CNN architecture comprises of nine layers for automatic feature extraction and classification of pulmonary nodule candidates as malignant or benign. Furthermore, the pre-trained model of proposed CNN is also used to handle the smaller dataset classification problem by using transfer learning.

A Joint Detection and Recognition Approach to Lung Cancer Diagnosis From CT Images With Label Uncertainty,L. Chenyang; S. -C. Chan,"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong",IEEE Access,30-Dec-20,2020,8,,228905,228921,"Automatic lung cancer diagnosis from computer tomography (CT) images requires the detection of nodule location as well as nodule malignancy prediction. This article proposes a joint lung nodule detection and classification network for simultaneous lung nodule detection, segmentation and classification subject to possible label uncertainty in the training set. It operates in an end-to-end manner and provides detection and classification of nodules simultaneously together with a segmentation of the detected nodules. Both the nodule detection and classification subnetworks of the proposed joint network adopt a 3-D encoder-decoder architecture for better exploration of the 3-D data. Moreover, the classification subnetwork utilizes the features extracted from the detection subnetwork and multiscale nodule-specific features for boosting the classification performance. The former serves as valuable prior information for optimizing the more complicated 3D classification network directly to better distinguish suspicious nodules from other tissues compared with direct backpropagation from the decoder. Experimental results show that this co-training yields better performance on both tasks. The framework is validated on the LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets and a pseudo-label approach is proposed for addressing the label uncertainty problem due to inconsistent annotations/labels. Experimental results show that the proposed nodule detector outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and yields comparable performance as state-of-the-art nodule classification algorithms when classification alone is considered. Since our joint detection/recognition approach can directly detect nodules and classify its malignancy instead of performing the tasks separately, our approach is more practical for automatic cancer and nodules detection.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044941,Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund(grant numbers:GRF 17211320); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294013,Deep learning;multi-task learning;nodule detection;nodule malignancy classification;label noise,Cancer;Computed tomography;Lung;Feature extraction;Training;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays,backpropagation;cancer;computerised tomography;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;lung;medical image processing,CT images;automatic lung cancer diagnosis;computer tomography images;nodule location;nodule malignancy prediction;joint lung nodule detection;simultaneous lung nodule detection;classification subnetwork;3-D encoder-decoder architecture;multiscale nodule-specific features;pseudolabel approach;label uncertainty problem;nodule detector;state-of-the-art nodule classification algorithms;LIDC-IDRI datasets,,6,,60,CCBY,15-Dec-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Adding noise without affecting the quality of details in the images makes the input images for the neural network more representative, which may improve the performance of the neural network model when used in the real world. The proposed method for background removal is the “Rolling Ball Algorithm” and “Huang's Fuzzy Thresholding”, which succeed in removing background from 100% of the images. For pectoral muscle removal “Canny Edge Detection” and “Hough's Line Transform” are used, which removed muscle from 99.06% of the images. “Invert”, “CTI_RAS” and “ISOCONTOUR” lookup tables (LUTs) were used for image enhancements to outline the ROIs and regions within the ROIs.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058773,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352727,Breast cancer;background removal;deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN);image enhancements;mammogram;mini-MIAS;pectoral muscle removal,Muscles;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Mammography;Breast cancer;Lung;Image enhancement,biological organs;cancer;edge detection;feature extraction;image classification;image enhancement;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;muscle;neural nets,Deep-CNN;effective image pre-processing methods;create datasets;classification rates;background removal;pectoral muscle removal;adding noise;image enhancements;input images;neural network model;Canny Edge Detection;breast cancer images;diagnosed cancer;crude incidence rates;Machine Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks;mammographic images;interpretation errors;false-negative cases;effective image pre-processing techniques;training data,,29,,69,CCBY,11-Feb-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In this study, deep learning-based classification methods were investigated comprehensively to differentiate two subtypes of NSCLC, namely adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). The study used 1457 18F-FDG PET images/slices with tumor from 94 patients (88 men), 38 of which were ADC and the rest were SqCC. Three experiments were carried out to examine the contribution of peritumoral areas in PET images on subtype classification of tumors. We assessed multilayer perceptron (MLP) and three convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as SqueezeNet, VGG16 and VGG19 using three kinds of images in these experiments: 1) Whole slices without cropping or segmentation, 2) cropped image portions (square subimages) that include the tumor and 3) segmented image portions corresponding to tumors using random walk method. Several optimizers and regularization methods were used to optimize each model for the diagnostic classification. The classification models were trained and evaluated by performing stratified 10-fold cross validation, and F-score and area-under-curve (AUC) metrics were used to quantify the performance. According to our results, it is possible to say that inclusion of peritumoral regions/tissues both contributes to the success of models and makes segmentation effort unnecessary. To the best of our knowledge, deep learning-based models have not been applied to the subtype classification of NSCLC in PET imaging, therefore, this study is a significant cornerstone providing thorough comparisons and evaluations of several deep learning models on metabolic imaging for lung cancer. Even simpler deep learning models are found promising in this domain, indicating that any improvement in deep learning models in machine learning community can be reflected well in this domain as well.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040155,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(grant numbers:113E188); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9270569,Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;PET imaging;subtype classification;non-small cell lung cancer,Tumors;Deep learning;Lung cancer;Imaging;Cancer;Standards;Positron emission tomography,cancer;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;multilayer perceptrons;neural nets;positron emission tomography;tumours,metabolic imaging based sub-classification;deadliest cancer types;nonsmall cell lung cancer;NSCLC;deep learning-based classification methods;ADC;squamous cell carcinoma;SqCC;tumor;peritumoral areas;subtype classification;convolutional neural network models;VGG16;VGG19;cropping segmentation;random walk method;optimizers;regularization methods;diagnostic classification;classification models;area-under-curve metrics;PET imaging,,9,,40,CCBY,25-Nov-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

To determine the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85% of lung cancer, comprehensive analysis of various clinical factors are necessary. Artificial intelligence can help physician quickly identify key information from the vast amount of medical information including positron emission tomography (PET) scan. In this study, we compared image feature-extraction models and survival estimation models to determine an optimal model that effectively extracts features related to survival time. We collected PET image data of 2,685 patients who were diagnosed with NSCLC and received treatment at the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital in South Korea over a period of seven years. We compared four convolution neural network models, DenseNet, NFNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet, and two survival estimation models, CoxPH and CoxCC. The best model was determined based on criteria such as C-index, mean absolute error (MAE), classification accuracy for survival status, and learning time. The results show that DenseNet combined with CoxPH delivers superior performance for most of the criteria. In particular, the MAE for this combination was very low (391.50 days), and the model predicted survival days well; the five-year classification accuracy, which can indicate a cure for cancer, was high (95%). Extracted features were visualized using Score-CAM; thus, the learning process of the model could be understood without requiring expert knowledge of PET. In addition, the learning time for this model was short.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115486,"Bio & Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2019M3E5D1A02067961); Korea Health Technology Research and Development Project through Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI); Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea(grant numbers:HR20C0021); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548081,Convolutional neural network;CoxPH;CoxCC;non-small cell lung cancer prognosis;Score-CAM;positron emission tomography;F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose,Positron emission tomography;Cancer;Lung cancer;Feature extraction;Prognostics and health management;Predictive models;Tumors,cancer;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);estimation theory;feature extraction;image classification;lung;medical image processing;medical information systems;positron emission tomography,patient prognosis;nonsmall cell lung cancer;cancer-related mortality;NSCLC;medical information;image feature-extraction models;survival estimation models;optimal model;survival time;PET image data;Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital;convolution neural network models;survival status;survival days;PET-based deep-learning model;positron emission tomography scan;DenseNet;NFNet;EfficientNet;ResNet;CoxPH;CoxCC;C-index;mean absolute error;classification accuracy;Score-CAM,,1,,49,CCBY,24-Sep-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
