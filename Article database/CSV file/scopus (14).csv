In order to effectively enhance low-quality underwater images, this paper proposes an enhancement method based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). This paper studies low-light image enhancement algorithms, aiming to improve the quality of low-light images by studying some technical means and methods, and restore the original scene information of low-quality images, so as to obtain natural and clear images with complete details and structural information. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, image databases such as DIARETDB0 and SID are used as the research object, combined with multi-scale Retinex color reproduction contrast-constrained adaptive histogram equalization to compare the performance of the enhanced algorithm. The results show that the processed image is better than other image enhancement methods in terms of color protection, contrast enhancement, and image detail enhancement.

To address the thorn problems on low detection sensitivity and high false-positive rate caused by heterogeneity and morphological complexity of 3-D nodule features, a computer-aided detection system is developed to increase the detection sensitivity and classification accuracy of pulmonary nodules. The contributions include: (1) Nodule candidate detection: 3-D Residual U-Net model is improved to detect candidate nodules, which constructs 3-D context-guided module to extract local and global nodule features by setting the dilated convolution with different dilation rates. Furthermore, channel attention mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the channel features, which enhances the generalization and expression ability of the detection-network to effectively learn 3-D spatial context features. (2) False-positive reduction: multi-branch classification network is designed for multi-task learning. Image reconstruction task is performed to retain more microscopic nodules information from convolutional neural network (CNN) hierarchy. Moreover, each branch deals with the feature map at corresponding depth layers, and then all branches' feature maps are combined together to perform nodule classification task. Numerous experimental results show that the proposed system is perfectly qualified for pulmonary nodules detection on Lung Nodules Analysis 2016 dataset, which achieves detection sensitivity up to 94.0% and competition performance metric (CPM) score up to 0.959. © 2013 IEEE.",3-D context-guided attention module; convolutional neural network; multi-branch classification; multi-task learning; pulmonary nodule detection,Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Feature extraction; Image reconstruction; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Positron emission tomography; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; 3d context-guided attention module; Classification networks; Convolutional neural network; Detection sensitivity; Features extraction; Lung Cancer; Multi-branch classification; Pulmonary nodule detection; Three-dimensional display; Biological organs,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122075051

To determine the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85% of lung cancer, comprehensive analysis of various clinical factors are necessary. Artificial intelligence can help physician quickly identify key information from the vast amount of medical information including positron emission tomography (PET) scan. In this study, we compared image feature-extraction models and survival estimation models to determine an optimal model that effectively extracts features related to survival time. We collected PET image data of 2,685 patients who were diagnosed with NSCLC and received treatment at the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital in South Korea over a period of seven years. We compared four convolution neural network models, DenseNet, NFNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet, and two survival estimation models, CoxPH and CoxCC. The best model was determined based on criteria such as C-index, mean absolute error (MAE), classification accuracy for survival status, and learning time. The results show that DenseNet combined with CoxPH delivers superior performance for most of the criteria. In particular, the MAE for this combination was very low (391.50 days), and the model predicted survival days well; the five-year classification accuracy, which can indicate a cure for cancer, was high (95%). Extracted features were visualized using Score-CAM; thus, the learning process of the model could be understood without requiring expert knowledge of PET. In addition, the learning time for this model was short. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network; CoxCC; CoxPH; F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose; non-small cell lung cancer prognosis; positron emission tomography; Score-CAM,Biological organs; Cams; Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Neural networks; Patient treatment; Positrons; Cancer prognosis; Convolutional neural network; CoxCC; CoxPH; F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose; Fluorodeoxyglucose; Lung Cancer; Non small cell lung cancer; Non-small cell lung cancer prognose; Score-CAM; Positron emission tomography,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115745897

In such scenarios, the Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems can help radiologists by doing the trivial processing and presenting the information in a meaningful way so that, the radiologist can make more accurate decisions by spending less amount of time and energy. This research study intends to propose a better, accurate, and efficient CNN based pulmonary disease diagnosis system using CXR images. In the proposed system, the capabilities of deep neural network architecture are exploited by proposing a custom CNN architecture with additional layers and modified hyperparameters to meet the required results. The input CXR is examined for healthy or infected at the surface level and the infected images are further processed for class level label classification. The lung region is segmented from the entire input CXR image to reduce the amount of noise and increase the processing efficiency by processing less overall information. The proposed model is evaluated on the benchmark split of the NIH chest x-ray dataset and achieves better segmentation and classification results when compared to the state of the art approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",Chest x-rays; classification; convolutional neural network; deep learning; pulmonary diseases; segmentation,Biological organs; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Image processing; Multilayer neural networks; Network architecture; Pulmonary diseases; X rays; Classification results; Computer aided diagnostics; Disease diagnosis; Hyperparameters; Lung segmentation; Pulmonary disease classification; Research studies; State-of-the-art approach; Deep neural networks,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114744818

However, because the number of lung CT images in current dataset is relatively small and the ratio of nodule samples to non-nodule samples is usually very different, this makes the training of neural networks difficult and poor performance of neural networks. Hence, LDNNET is proposed, which adopts Dense-Block, batch normalization (BN) and dropout to cope with these problems. Meanwhile, LDNNET is an adaptive architecture based on convnets combining softmax classifier which is utilized to alleviate the problems of training deep convnets. Follows are our main work: Firstly, we utilized LDNNET on database LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) for lung nodule classification and database KAGGLE DATA-SCIENCE-BOWL-2017(Kaggle DSB 2017) for lung cancer classification; Secondly, the comparison experiments are designed to compare the performance of dense connection, pooling layer and the input pixel size of lung CT(Computed Tomography) images; Thirdly, data enhancement, dense connection and dropout layer were utilized in LDNNET to reduce overfitting; Fourthly, pre-processing methods, for instance enhanced contrast, median filtering, Laplacian filtering are compared to the no-processing method to explore the effect of pre-processing on lung CT images classification. Fifthly, accuracy, specificity and sensitivity on LUNA16 are 0.988396, 0.994585 and 0.982072 and these indicators on Kaggle DSB 2017 are 0.999480, 0.999652 and 0.998974. Furthermore, AUC for both two datasets is over 0.98. Consequently, this paper conducts experiments with uniform parameter settings on two publicly available databases and shows that even in challenging situation where lung images are directly utilized as input images without preprocessing, LDNNET is still the more advanced algorithm than other recent algorithms respectively. Moreover, a series of comparative experiments were conducted to further confirm that the proposed algorithm has the higher accuracy and robustness through verification and discussion. © 2013 IEEE.",classification; Deep dense neural network; lung cancer; lung nodule,Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Data Science; Database systems; Diseases; Image enhancement; Median filters; Processing; Adaptive architecture; Comparative experiments; Diagnosis of lung cancer; Enhanced contrast; Parameter setting; Pre-processing method; Processing method; Robust classification; Biological organs,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103296627

The wide application of deep learning technology in the field of medical imaging also provides new ideas for the computer-aided diagnosis of parotid gland tumors. In addition, because the pathological types of parotid gland tumors are very complicated and the computed tomography (CT) images of benign and malignant patients are also very similar, some clinicians may misjudge tumors due to a lack of experience, which affects the effect of surgical treatment and prognosis. Therefore, this research proposes using deep learning methods to solve this problem. This study uses the four classic pretraining models of VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet and DenseNet to classify parotid CT images using transfer learning methods and uses an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify parotid CT images. The experimental results show that the improved CNN model achieves an accuracy of 97.78%, and its classification performance is better than those of the other four transfer learning methods.

To solve this problem, a semisupervised clustering algorithm combined with a 3D convolutional neural network model is proposed to improve the classification performance for benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. The research contents are as follows: Firstly, a multiresolution 3D dual path squeeze excitation deep learning network model is constructed. Then, the feature extractor in the network model is used to extract the high-level features of the image, and semisupervised clustering is applied to the extracted image features. The corresponding pseudolabels can be obtained for the unlabeled samples, and the categories of unlabeled samples are determined and utilized. Finally, the oversampling algorithm is used to balance the data categories of different types of samples, and the benign and malignant pulmonary nodules are classified by a classifier constructed by a 3D dual path squeeze excitation network. The experimental results show that the proposed semisupervised clustering algorithm can label the categories of unlabeled samples.

However, the size of a nodule is very diverse and can range anywhere between 3 and 30 millimeters. The high variation of nodule sizes makes classifying them a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we propose a novel CNN architecture called Gated-Dilated (GD) networks to classify nodules as malignant or benign. Unlike previous studies, the GD network uses multiple dilated convolutions instead of max-poolings to capture the scale variations. Moreover, the GD network has a Context-Aware sub-network that analyzes the input features and guides the features to a suitable dilated convolution. We evaluated the proposed network on more than 1,000 CT scans from the LIDC-LDRI dataset. Our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models including Multi-Crop, Resnet, and Densenet, with an AUC of >0.95.

However, the exponential increase of image data makes their accurate assessment a very challenging task given that the number of radiologists is limited and they have been overworked. Recently, numerous methods, especially ones based on deep learning with convolutional neural network (CNN), have been developed to automatically detect and classify pulmonary nodules in medical images. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of these methods and their performances. First, we briefly introduce the fundamental knowledge of CNN as well as the reasons for their suitability to medical images analysis. Then, a brief description of various medical images datasets, as well as the environmental setup essential for facilitating lung nodule investigations with CNNs, is presented. Furthermore, comprehensive overviews of recent progress in pulmonary nodule analysis using CNNs are provided. Finally, existing challenges and promising directions for further improving the application of CNN to medical images analysis and pulmonary nodule assessment, in particular, are discussed. It is shown that CNNs have transformed greatly the early diagnosis and management of lung cancer. We believe that this review will provide all the medical research communities with the necessary knowledge to master the concept of CNN so as to utilize it for improving the overall human healthcare system. © 2019 IEEE.",computed tomography (CT) images; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; image classification; Lung cancer; pulmonary nodules,Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image analysis; Image classification; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Positron emission tomography; Comprehensive analysis; Convolutional neural network; Exponential increase; Health-care system; Lung Cancer; Medical research; Pulmonary nodules; Recent progress; Image enhancement,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068340428

Early and accurate diagnosis of SCLC is vital for improved survival. Accurate cancer segmentation helps doctors understand the location and size of cancer and make better diagnostic decisions. However, manual segmentation of lung cancers from large amounts of medical images is a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation network (referred to as HSN) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment SCLC from computed tomography (CT) images. The design philosophy of our model is to combine a lightweight 3D CNN to learn long-range 3D contextual information and a 2D CNN to learn fine-grained semantic information, which is essential for accurate cancer segmentation. We propose a hybrid features fusion module to effectively fuse the 2D and 3D features and to jointly train these two CNNs. We utilize a generalized Dice loss function to tackle the severe class imbalance problem in data. A dataset consists of 134 CT scans was constructed to evaluate our model. Our model achieved high performances with a mean Dice score of 0.888, a mean sensitivity score of 0.872 and a mean precision of 0.909, outperforming the other state-of-the-art 2D and 3D CNN methods by a large margin. © 2013 IEEE.",CT; deep convolutional neural network; hybrid features fusion; Small cell lung cancer,Biological organs; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Semantics; Class imbalance problems; Contextual information; Convolutional neural network; Diagnostic decisions; Hybrid features; Semantic information; Small cell lung cancers; Small-cell lung cancer; Computerized tomography,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068220498

In order to achieve this, it is necessary to reduce the false positive rate of detection. Due to the heterogeneity of lung nodules and their similarity to the background, it is difficult to distinguish true lung nodules from numerous candidate nodules. In this paper, in order to solve this challenging problem, we propose a Multi-Branch Ensemble Learning architecture based on the three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (MBEL-3D-CNN). The method combines three key ideas: 1) constructing a 3D-CNN to make the maximum utilization of spatial information of lung nodules in the 3D space; 2) embedding a multi-branch network architecture in the 3D-CNN that is well adapted to the heterogeneity of lung nodules, and; 3) using ensemble learning to effectively improve the generalization performance of the 3D-CNN model. In addition, we use offline hard mining operations to make the network capable of handling those indistinguishable positive and negative samples. The proposed method was tested on the dataset LUNA16 in our experiments. The experimental results show that MBEL-3D-CNN architecture can achieve better screening results. © 2019 IEEE.",3D CNN; Computer-aided diagnosis; ensemble learning; false positive reduction; offline hard mining,3D modeling; Biological organs; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Computerized tomography; Neural networks; 3D CNN; Convolutional neural network; Detection of lung nodules; Ensemble learning; False-positive reduction; Generalization performance; Offline; Threedimensional (3-d); Network architecture,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067239163

Because early lung cancer nodules are small, making them difficult to detect, the current automatic lung cancer detection system can easily lead to missed diagnosis when detecting these nodules; therefore, accurate detection of early lung cancer nodules is crucial for improving the lung cancer cure rate. To reduce the missed diagnosis rate of early nodules in the detection system, it is necessary to optimize the extraction steps of candidate nodules. Based on the improvement of U-Net, this paper proposes noisy U-Net (NU-Net), which can enhance the neural network's sensitivity to small nodules by adding a special noise to the hidden layers in training. The neural network is trained using the LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 dataset and the Alibaba Tianchi Lung Cancer Detection Competition dataset. The comparative experiment between the U-Net and NU-Net reveals that the proposed algorithm's sensitivity to small nodules with diameters of 3-5 mm (97.1%) is greater than the U-Net value (90.5%). © 2013 IEEE.",computed tomography; computer-aided diagnosis; Lung cancer; lung nodule candidates; neural networks,Chemical detection; Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Diseases; Neural networks; Comparative experiments; Cure rate; Detection system; Hidden layers; Lung Cancer; Lung cancer detections; Lung nodule; Small nodules; Biological organs,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067207676

An automated detection system usually contains two major steps: candidate detection and false positive (FP) reduction. We propose a novel strategy for fast candidate detection from volumetric chest CT scans, which can minimize false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs). The core of the strategy is a nodule-size-adaptive deep model that can detect nodules of various types, locations, and sizes from 3D images. After candidate detection, each result is located with a bounding cube, which can provide rough size information of the detected objects. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective CNNs-based classifier for FP reduction, which benefits from the candidate detection. The performance of the proposed nodule detection was evaluated on both independent and publicly available datasets. Our detection could reach high sensitivity with few FPs and it was comparable with the state-of-the-art systems and manual screenings. The study demonstrated that excellent candidate detection plays an important role in the nodule detection and can simplify the design of the FP reduction. The proposed candidate detection is an independent module, so it can be incorporated with any other FP reduction methods. Besides, it can be used as a potential solution for other similar clinical applications. © 2013 IEEE.",Computed tomography; convolutional neural networks; deep-learning; object detection; pulmonary nodule,Deep learning; Neural networks; Object detection; Positron emission tomography; Adaptive detection; Automated detection; Clinical application; Convolutional neural network; Novel strategies; Pulmonary nodule detection; Pulmonary nodules; State-of-the-art system; Computerized tomography,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064757103
