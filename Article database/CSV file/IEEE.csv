The objective of this paper is to effectively address the challenges in this task and therefore to accurately discriminate the true nodules from a large number of candidates. Methods: We propose a novel method employing three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for false positive reduction in automated pulmonary nodule detection from volumetric computed tomography (CT) scans. Compared with its 2-D counterparts, the 3-D CNNs can encode richer spatial information and extract more representative features via their hierarchical architecture trained with 3-D samples. More importantly, we further propose a simple yet effective strategy to encode multilevel contextual information to meet the challenges coming with the large variations and hard mimics of pulmonary nodules. Results: The proposed framework has been extensively validated in the LUNA16 challenge held in conjunction with ISBI 2016, where we achieved the highest competition performance metric (CPM) score in the false positive reduction track. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of integrating multilevel contextual information into 3-D CNN framework for automated pulmonary nodule detection in volumetric CT data.

Deep learning methods have recently been successfully introduced to computer vision problems, although substantial challenges remain in the detection of malignant nodules due to the lack of large training data sets. In this paper, we propose a multi-view knowledge-based collaborative (MV-KBC) deep model to separate malignant from benign nodules using limited chest CT data. Our model learns 3-D lung nodule characteristics by decomposing a 3-D nodule into nine fixed views. For each view, we construct a knowledge-based collaborative (KBC) submodel, where three types of image patches are designed to fine-tune three pre-trained ResNet-50 networks that characterize the nodules' overall appearance, voxel, and shape heterogeneity, respectively. We jointly use the nine KBC submodels to classify lung nodules with an adaptive weighting scheme learned during the error back propagation, which enables the MV-KBC model to be trained in an end-to-end manner. The penalty loss function is used for better reduction of the false negative rate with a minimal effect on the overall performance of the MV-KBC model. We tested our method on the benchmark LIDC-IDRI data set and compared it to the five state-of-the-art classification approaches. Our results show that the MV-KBC model achieved an accuracy of 91.60% for lung nodule classification with an AUC of 95.70%.

Currently, there are many studies about the first step, but few about the second step. Since the existence of nodule does not definitely indicate cancer, and the morphology of nodule has a complicated relationship with cancer, the diagnosis of lung cancer demands careful investigations on every suspicious nodule and integration of information of all nodules. We propose a 3-D deep neural network to solve this problem. The model consists of two modules. The first one is a 3-D region proposal network for nodule detection, which outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject. The second one selects the top five nodules based on the detection confidence, evaluates their cancer probabilities, and combines them with a leaky noisy-OR gate to obtain the probability of lung cancer for the subject. The two modules share the same backbone network, a modified U-net. The overfitting caused by the shortage of the training data is alleviated by training the two modules alternately.

The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases.

As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Here, we have collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 100 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the data, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. The experimental results showed that our model could accurately discriminate the COVID-19 patients from the bacteria pneumonia patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96, and precision of 0.79.

It is a significant and challenging task to quickly locate the exact positions of lung nodules. Extensive work has been done by researchers around this domain for approximately two decades. However, previous computer-aided detection (CADe) schemes are mostly intricate and time-consuming since they may require more image processing modules, such as the computed tomography image transformation, the lung nodule segmentation, and the feature extraction, to construct a whole CADe system. It is difficult for these schemes to process and analyze enormous data when the medical images continue to increase. Besides, some state of the art deep learning schemes may be strict in the standard of database. This study proposes an effective lung nodule detection scheme based on multigroup patches cut out from the lung images, which are enhanced by the Frangi filter. Through combining two groups of images, a four-channel convolution neural networks model is designed to learn the knowledge of radiologists for detecting nodules of four levels. This CADe scheme can acquire the sensitivity of 80.06% with 4.7 false positives per scan and the sensitivity of 94% with 15.1 false positives per scan.

In identifying initial nodule candidates (INCs) within the lungs, the low-level VQ proves to be effective for INCs detection and segmentation, as well as computationally efficient compared to existing approaches. False-positive (FP) reduction is conducted via rule-based filtering operations in combination with a feature-based support vector machine classifier. The proposed system was validated on 205 patient cases from the publically available online Lung Image Database Consortium database, with each case having at least one juxta-pleural nodule annotation. Experimental results demonstrated that our CADe system obtained an overall sensitivity of 82.7% at a specificity of 4 FPs/scan.

Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease.",1558-254X,,10.1109/TMI.2020.3001810,"Office of Sponsored Research (OSR), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(grant numbers:FCC/1/1976-04,FCC/1/1976-06,FCC/1/1976-17,FCC/1/1976-18,FCC/1/1976-23,FCC/1/1976-25,FCC/1/1976-26,URF/1/3450-01,URF/1/4098-01-01,REI/1/0018-01-01); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61731008,61871428,U1809205); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province of China(grant numbers:LJ19H180001); Ministry of Science and Technology Central Guiding Local Science and Technology Development Project(grant numbers:ZY18C01); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115057,COVID-19;deep learning;segmentation;computerized tomography,Computed tomography;Solid modeling;Lung;Three-dimensional displays;Image segmentation;COVID-19,computerised tomography;data analysis;diseases;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical image processing;patient diagnosis,machine-agnostic segmentation;quantification method;CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis;treatment strategies;RNA virus-based disease;CT imaging;artificial intelligence;CT scan simulator;computer-aided systems,"Algorithms;Betacoronavirus;Coronavirus Infections;Deep Learning;Humans;Lung;Pandemics;Pneumonia, Viral;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",64,,37,CCBY,11-Jun-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Co-Learning Feature Fusion Maps From PET-CT Images of Lung Cancer,A. Kumar; M. Fulham; D. Feng; J.

Current methods for PET-CT image analysis either process the modalities separately or fuse information from each modality based on knowledge about the image analysis task. These methods generally do not consider the spatially varying visual characteristics that encode different information across different modalities, which have different priorities at different locations. For example, a high abnormal PET uptake in the lungs is more meaningful for tumor detection than physiological PET uptake in the heart. Our aim is to improve the fusion of the complementary information in multi-modality PET-CT with a new supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to fuse complementary information for multi-modality medical image analysis. Our CNN first encodes modalityspecific features and then uses them to derive a spatially varying fusion map that quantifies the relative importance of each modality's feature across different spatial locations. These fusion maps are then multiplied with the modalityspecific feature maps to obtain a representation of the complementary multi-modality information at different locations, which can then be used for image analysis. We evaluated the ability of our CNN to detect and segment multiple regions (lungs, mediastinum, and tumors) with different fusion requirements using a dataset of PET-CT images of lung cancer. We compared our method to baseline techniques for multi-modality image fusion (fused inputs (FSs), multi-branch (MB) techniques, and multi-channel (MC) techniques) and segmentation. Our findings show that our CNN had a significantly higher foreground detection accuracy (99.29%, p <; 0.05) than the fusion baselines (FS: 99.00%, MB: 99.08%, and TC: 98.92%) and a significantly higher Dice score (63.85%) than the recent PET-CT tumor segmentation methods.",1558-254X,,10.1109/TMI.2019.2923601,Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP160103675); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737963,Multi-modality imaging;deep learning;fusion learning;PET-CT,Computed tomography;Tumors;Lung;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Cancer,cancer;computerised tomography;image classification;image fusion;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;neural nets;positron emission tomography;tumours,fusion requirements;PET-CT images;lung cancer;CNN;fusion baselines;recent PET-CT tumor segmentation methods;fusion maps;multimodality positron emission tomography;computed tomography images;computer-aided diagnosis applications;PET-CT image analysis;image analysis task;encode different information;high abnormal PET uptake;tumor detection;physiological PET uptake;complementary information;multimodality PET-CT;multimodality medical image analysis;modalityspecific features;spatially varying fusion map;modality;spatial locations;modalityspecific feature maps;complementary multimodality information,,42,,85,IEEE,17-Jun-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, there still exist multiple nodule candidates produced by initial rough detection in this system, and how to determine authenticity is a key problem. As this work is often challenged by the radiological heterogeneity of the computed tomography scans and the variable sizes of lung nodules, we put forward a multi-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features of various levels and resolutions from different depth layers in the network for classification of lung nodule candidates. Through the use of knowledge transfer, the method can be divided into three steps. First, we transfer knowledge from the source CNN model which has been applied to edge detection and improve the model to a new multi-resolution model which is suitable for the image classification task. Then, the knowledge is transformed from source training progress so that all of the side-output branches in the model will be considered in the calculation. Moreover, the loss function and objective equation are improved to be image-wise calculation rather than pixel-wise. Finally, samples production and data enhancement are performed to train and test a classifier tailored for classification of lung nodule candidates. The experimental results on the LUNA16 data set show that our method gets an accuracy of 0.9733, a precision of 0.9673, and an AUC of 0.9954 while being used for lung nodule candidate classification, which is higher than the scores obtained by most of the state-of-the-art approach. In addition, when the test samples with three different sizes of 26*26, 36*36, and 48*48 are used to test the multi-resolution CNN, the accuracy rate of all three experiments exceed 92.81%, which demonstrates that the proposed model is insensitive to input scales.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903587,National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8662660,Convolutional neural network;lung nodule candidate classification;multi-resolution model;knowledge transfer,Lung;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Knowledge transfer;Computed tomography;Convolutional neural networks;Shape,cancer;computerised tomography;convolutional neural nets;edge detection;feature extraction;image classification;lung;medical image processing,multiple nodule candidates;initial rough detection;lung nodules;multiresolution convolutional neural network;resolutions;lung nodule candidates;knowledge transfer;source CNN model;multiresolution model;image classification task;lung nodule candidate classification;multiresolution CNN;automatic lung nodule detection system;lung cancer;timely medical interventions,,40,,42,OAPA,7-Mar-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The majority of fissure detection methods use feature descriptors that are hand-crafted, low-level, and have local spatial extent. The design of such feature detectors is typically targeted toward normal fissure anatomy, yielding low sensitivity to weak, and abnormal fissures that are common in clinical data sets. Furthermore, local features commonly suffer from low specificity, as the complex textures in the lung can be indistinguishable from the fissure when the global context is not considered. We propose a supervised discriminative learning framework for simultaneous feature extraction and classification. The proposed framework, called FissureNet, is a coarse-to-fine cascade of two convolutional neural networks. The coarse-to-fine strategy alleviates the challenges associated with training a network to segment a thin structure that represents a small fraction of the image voxels. FissureNet was evaluated on a cohort of 3706 subjects with inspiration and expiration 3DCT scans from the COPDGene clinical trial and a cohort of 20 subjects with 4DCT scans from a lung cancer clinical trial. On both data sets, FissureNet showed superior performance compared with a deep learning approach using the U-Net architecture and a Hessian-based fissure detection method in terms of area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC). The overall PR-AUC for FissureNet, U-Net, and Hessian on the COPDGene (lung cancer) data set was 0.980 (0.966), 0.963 (0.937), and 0.158 (0.182), respectively. On a subset of 30 COPDGene scans, FissureNet was compared with a recently proposed advanced fissure detection method called derivative of sticks (DoS) and showed superior performance with a PR-AUC of 0.991 compared with 0.668 for DoS.",1558-254X,,10.1109/TMI.2018.2858202,"National Cancer Institute(grant numbers:CA166703); Graduate College, University of Iowa; Iowa Space Grant Consortium; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8432388,Lung;segmentation;X-ray imaging and computed tomography;machine learning;ConvNet;CNN,Lung;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Detectors;Machine learning;Training,cancer;computerised tomography;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing,coarse-to-fine cascade;coarse-to-fine strategy;COPDGene clinical trial;lung cancer clinical trial;deep learning approach;Hessian-based fissure detection method;PR-AUC;COPDGene data set;recently proposed advanced fissure detection method;pulmonary fissure detection;automatic lobar segmentation;feature descriptors;local spatial extent;feature detectors;normal fissure anatomy;abnormal fissures;clinical data sets;local features;supervised discriminative learning framework;simultaneous feature extraction;classification;CT images;FissureNet;computed tomography;convolutional neural networks;image voxels;3DCT scans;4DCT scans,"Algorithms;Deep Learning;Humans;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",39,,47,IEEE,10-Aug-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Exploiting this coupling allows us to develop an end-to-end system that has higher and more robust performance and eliminates the need for a nodule detection false positive reduction stage. Furthermore, we characterize model uncertainty in our deep learning systems, a first for lung CT analysis, and show that we can use this to provide well-calibrated classification probabilities for both nodule detection and patient malignancy diagnosis.

Information on nodule morphology is captured by sampling intensity profiles along circular patterns on spherical surfaces centered on the nodule, in a multi-scale fashion. Each intensity profile is interpreted as a periodic signal, where the Fourier transform is applied, obtaining a spectrum. A library of spectra is created and labeled via unsupervised clustering, obtaining a Bag-of-Frequencies, which is used to assign each spectra a label. The descriptor is obtained as the histogram of labels along all the spheres. Additional contributions are a technique to estimate the nodule size, based on the sampling strategy, as well as a technique to choose the most informative plane to cut a 2-D view of the nodule in the 3-D image. We evaluate the descriptor on several nodule morphology classification problems, namely discrimination of nodules versus vascular structures and characterization of spiculation.

Inspired by the clinical methodology of radiologists, we aim to explore the feasibility of applying MIP images to improve the effectiveness of automatic lung nodule detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The use of thick MIP images helps the detection of small pulmonary nodules (3 mm-10 mm) and results in fewer false positives. Experimental results show that utilizing MIP images can increase the sensitivity and lower the number of false positives, which demonstrates the effectiveness and significance of the proposed MIP-based CNNs framework for automatic pulmonary nodule detection in CT scans.

Automated lung nodule analysis requires both accurate lung nodule benign-malignant classification and attribute score regression. However, this is quite challenging due to the considerable difficulty of lung nodule heterogeneity modeling and the limited discrimination capability on ambiguous cases. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-Task deep model with Margin Ranking loss (referred as MTMR-Net) for automated lung nodule analysis. Compared to existing methods which consider these two tasks separately, the relatedness between lung nodule classification and attribute score regression is explicitly explored in a cause-and-effect manner within our multi-task deep model, which can contribute to the performance gains of both tasks. The results of different tasks can be yielded simultaneously for assisting the radiologists in diagnosis interpretation. Furthermore, a Siamese network with a margin ranking loss is elaborately designed to enhance the discrimination capability on ambiguous nodule cases. To further explore the internal relationship between two tasks and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we use the recursive feature elimination method to iteratively rank the most malignancy-related features.

Three-dimensional morphological nodular tissue properties are described in terms of 3-D Riesz-wavelets. The responses of the latter are aggregated within nodular regions by means of feature covariances, which leverage rich intra- and inter-variations of the feature space dimensions. When compared to the classical use of the average for feature aggregation, feature covariances preserve spatial co-variations between features. The obtained Riesz-covariance descriptors lie on a manifold governed by Riemannian geometry allowing geodesic measurements and differentiations. The latter property is incorporated both into a kernel for support vector machines (SVM) and a manifold-aware sparse regularized classifier. The effectiveness of the presented models is evaluated on a dataset of 110 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and cancer recurrence information. Disease recurrence within a timeframe of 12 months could be predicted with an accuracy of 81.3-82.7%.

It has a high death rate and its incidence rate has been increasing all over the world. Lung cancer appears as a solitary nodule in chest x-ray radiograph (CXR). Therefore, lung nodule detection in CXR could have a significant impact on early detection of lung cancer. Radiologists define a lung nodule in CXR as â€œsolitary white nodule-like blob.â€ However, the solitary feature has not been employed for lung nodule detection before. In this paper, a solitary feature-based lung nodule detection method was proposed. We employed stationary wavelet transform and convergence index filter to extract the texture features and used AdaBoost to generate white nodule-likeness map. A solitary feature was defined to evaluate the isolation degree of candidates. Both the isolation degree and the white nodule likeness were used as final evaluation of lung nodule candidates. The proposed method shows better performance and robustness than those reported in previous research. More than 80% and 93% of lung nodules in the lung field in the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) database were detected when the false positives per image were two and five, respectively.

However, single learner usually presents unsatisfied performance due to limited hypothesis space, or falling into local minima, or wrong selection of hypothesis space. To tackle these issues, we propose to build ensemble learners through fusing multiple deep CNN learners for pulmonary nodules classification. CT image patches of 743 nodules are extracted from LIDC-IDRI database and utilized. First, eight deep CNN learners with different architectures are trained and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation. Each nodule has eight predictions from the eight primary learners. Second, we fuse these eight predictions by the strategies of majority voting (VOT), averaging (AVE), or machine learning. Specifically, different machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) are implemented. Moreover, the correlation coefficients between the predictions of 10 ensemble learners are calculated, and the hierarchical clustering dendrogram is drawn. It is found that the ensemble learners achieve higher prediction accuracy (84.0% vs 81.7%) than single CNN learner. The overlap ratio among the 10 ensemble learners is much higher than that of the 8 primary learners (62.9% vs 33.2%). In addition, it is shown that ensemble learners are roughly divided into three categories: the first (SVM, MLP, GBRT and RF) achieves the best performance; the second (VOT and AVE) is better than the third (AdaBoost, DT, NB and KNN). VOT and AVE yield higher recall than the machine learning algorithms.

The first stage based on the improved U-Net segmentation network is to establish an initial detection of lung nodules. During this stage, in order to obtain a high recall rate without introducing excessive false positive nodules, we propose a new sampling strategy for training. Simultaneously, a two-phase prediction method is also proposed in this stage. The second stage in the TSCNN architecture based on the proposed dual pooling structure is built into three 3D-CNN classification networks for false positive reduction. Since the network training requires a significant amount of training data, we designed a random mask as the data augmentation method in this study.

However, lacking the capability to represent local characteristics of interested structures of the LdCT image adaptively may result in poor preservation of details/textures in LdCT image. This paper aims to explore a novel prior knowledge retrieval and representation paradigm, called adaptive prior features assisted restoration algorithm, for the purpose of better restoration of the low-dose lung CT images by capturing local features from FdCT scans adaptively. The innovation lies in the construction of an offline training database and the online patch-search scheme integrated with the principal components analysis (PCA). Specifically, the offline training database is composed of 3-D patch samples extracted from existing full-dose lung scans. For online patch-search, 3-D patches with structure similar to the noisy target patch are first selected from the database as the training samples. Then, PCA is applied on the training samples to retrieve their local prior principal features adaptively. By employing the principal features to decompose the noisy target patch and using an adaptive coefficient shrinkage technique for inverse transformation, the noise of the target patch can be efficiently removed and the detailed texture can be well preserved. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated by CT scans of patients with lung cancer.

To efficiently segment a 3-D lung, we extract voxel-wise features of spatial image contexts by unsupervised learning with a proposed incremental constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (ICNMF). The method applies smoothness constraints to learn the features, which are more robust to lung tissue inhomogeneities, and thus, help to better segment internal lung pathologies than the known state-of-the-art techniques. Compared to the latter, the ICNMF depends less on the domain expert knowledge and is more easily tuned due to only a few control parameters. Also, the proposed slice-wise incremental learning with due regard for interslice signal dependencies decreases the computational complexity of the NMF-based segmentation and is scalable to very large 3-D lung images. The method is quantitatively validated on simulated realistic lung phantoms that mimic different lung pathologies (seven datasets), in vivo datasets for 17 subjects, and 55 datasets from the Lobe and Lung Analysis 2011 (LOLA11) study. For the in vivo data, the accuracy of our segmentation w.r.t. the ground truth is 0.96 by the Dice similarity coefficient, 9.0 mm by the modified Hausdorff distance, and 0.87% by the absolute lung volume difference, which is significantly better than for the NMF-based segmentation.

To prove the performance of the proposed method, both the private and public databases were used. The private database is used to select the optimal parameters for the proposed method, where the result showed a good performance with the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as high as 97.08%.

Because early lung cancer nodules are small, making them difficult to detect, the current automatic lung cancer detection system can easily lead to missed diagnosis when detecting these nodules; therefore, accurate detection of early lung cancer nodules is crucial for improving the lung cancer cure rate. To reduce the missed diagnosis rate of early nodules in the detection system, it is necessary to optimize the extraction steps of candidate nodules. Based on the improvement of U-Net, this paper proposes noisy U-Net (NU-Net), which can enhance the neural network's sensitivity to small nodules by adding a special noise to the hidden layers in training.

In addition, a mathematical description for 3D pulmonary entities using neighbor centroids clustering is provided as a fundamental condition for spatial feature extraction. To optimize features extraction, we formulate a gray values cumulative function and a patches selection function based on the mathematical description, to generate axial spatial outline and spatial density distribution samples of the entities, respectively. Then, we use Edge Orientation Histogram (EOH) to extract edge features from the spatial outline and propose a multi-scale path LBP (MSPLBP) to extract the texture feature of the density distribution samples. Finally, the fused EOH and MSPLBP are classified into 6 malignancy levels by three state-of-the-art classifiers. The experimental results show that the vessel segmentation method achieves an average F1_Score of 78.14% and AUC value under PR curves of 0.8149. Moreover, our system reaches an average accuracy of 95.88% and consumes average 176.26 seconds for evaluating a CT set on malignancy level classification. These results indicate that the system can segment vessels exactly, and classify the malignancy level of nodules efficiently. Our system is the potential to be a powerful tool for early diagnosis of lung cancer.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976575,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N161608001,N180716019); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016176,Lung nodule;malignancy level classification;computer-aided diagnosis;vessels segmentation;Frangi filter;feature extraction,Feature extraction;Lung;Image segmentation;Cancer;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Image edge detection,cancer;computerised tomography;edge detection;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;lung;medical image processing;pattern clustering,lung nodules;lung cancer mortality rate;CAD system;nodules malignancy level classification;vessel likelihood;irregular vascular structures;vessel segmentation;3D pulmonary entities;neighbor centroids clustering;spatial feature extraction;gray values cumulative function;patches selection function;axial spatial outline;spatial density distribution samples;edge features;texture feature;edge orientation histogram;classifiers;CT set,,5,,47,CCBY,27-Feb-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

With this in mind, this study assesses the potential of using gaze information for integrating automatic detection systems in the clinical practice. For that purpose, 4 radiologists were asked to annotate 20 scans from a public dataset while being monitored by an eye tracker device, and an automatic lung nodule detection system was developed.

We propose a memory-augmented capsule network for the rapid adaptation of CAD models to new domains. It consists of a capsule network that is meant to extract feature embeddings from some high-dimensional input, and a memory-augmented task network meant to exploit its stored knowledge from the target domains. Our network is able to efficiently adapt to unseen domains using only a few annotated samples. We evaluate our method using a large-scale public lung nodule dataset (LUNA), coupled with our own collected lung nodules and incidental lung nodules datasets. When trained on the LUNA dataset, our network requires only 30 additional samples from our collected lung nodule and incidental lung nodule datasets to achieve clinically relevant performance (0.925 and 0.891 area under receiving operating characteristic curves (AUROC), respectively).

Using computer vision techniques to detect nodules can improve the sensitivity and the speed of interpreting chest CT for lung cancer screening. Many studies have used CNNs to detect nodule candidates. Though such approaches have been shown to outperform the conventional image processing based methods regarding the detection accuracy, CNNs are also known to be limited to generalize on under-represented samples in the training set and prone to imperceptible noise perturbations. Such limitations can not be easily addressed by scaling up the dataset or the models. In this work, we propose to add adversarial synthetic nodules and adversarial attack samples to the training data to improve the generalization and the robustness of the lung nodule detection systems. To generate hard examples of nodules from a differentiable nodule synthesizer, we use projected gradient descent (PGD) to search the latent code within a bounded neighbourhood that would generate nodules to decrease the detector response. To make the network more robust to unanticipated noise perturbations, we use PGD to search for noise patterns that can trigger the network to give over-confident mistakes. By evaluating on two different benchmark datasets containing consensus annotations from three radiologists, we show that the proposed techniques can improve the detection performance on real CT data. To understand the limitations of both the conventional networks and the proposed augmented networks, we also perform stress-tests on the false positive reduction networks by feeding different types of artificially produced patches. We show that the augmented networks are more robust to both under-represented nodules as well as resistant to noise perturbations.",1558-254X,,10.1109/TMI.2020.3026261,National Cancer Institute for Access to NCIâ€™s Data Collected; National Lung Screening Trial (NLST); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9204673,Lung nodule detection;adversarial attack;medical image synthesis;deep learning,Training;Robustness;Lung;Cancer;Computed tomography;Biomedical imaging;Benchmark testing,cancer;computer vision;computerised tomography;diagnostic radiography;gradient methods;lung;medical image processing,unanticipated noise perturbations;CT data;augmented networks;training robust lung nodule detection;low-dose CT scans;adversarial attacks;malignant pulmonary nodules;lung cancer patients;computer vision techniques;chest CT;lung cancer screening;CNN;conventional image processing based methods;adversarial synthetic nodules;training data;lung nodule detection systems;imperceptible noise perturbations;projected gradient descent,"Early Detection of Cancer;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Solitary Pulmonary Nodule;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",5,,49,IEEE,23-Sep-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Therefore, the detection of pulmonary nodules is of great significance to save lives. However, in the face of a large number of lung CT image sequences, doctors need to spend a lot of time and energy, and in the detection process will inevitably produce the problem of false detection and missed detection. Therefore, it is very necessary for computer-aided doctors to detect pulmonary nodules. It is difficult to segment pulmonary nodules accurately and recognize the characteristics of pulmonary nodules in CT images. A complete set of semi-automatic lung nodule extraction and feature identification system is established, which is in line with the doctorâ€™s diagnosis process. A segmentation algorithm of pulmonary nodules based on regional statistical information is proposed to extract pulmonary nodules accurately. This is the first time that dynamic time warping algorithm is applied in the field of image processing, focusing on the lung nodule boundary. On this basis, the recursive graph visualization model is established to realize the visualization of boundary similarity. Finally, in order to accurately identify the characteristics of pulmonary nodules, a video similarity distance discrimination system is introduced to quantify the similarity between the nodules to be examined and the pulmonary nodules in the database. The experimental results show that the algorithm can accurately identify the normal shape, lobulated shape and lobulated shape of pulmonary nodules. The average processing speed is 0.58s/nodule.

A Joint Detection and Recognition Approach to Lung Cancer Diagnosis From CT Images With Label Uncertainty,L. Chenyang; S. -C.

This article proposes a joint lung nodule detection and classification network for simultaneous lung nodule detection, segmentation and classification subject to possible label uncertainty in the training set. It operates in an end-to-end manner and provides detection and classification of nodules simultaneously together with a segmentation of the detected nodules. Both the nodule detection and classification subnetworks of the proposed joint network adopt a 3-D encoder-decoder architecture for better exploration of the 3-D data. Moreover, the classification subnetwork utilizes the features extracted from the detection subnetwork and multiscale nodule-specific features for boosting the classification performance. The former serves as valuable prior information for optimizing the more complicated 3D classification network directly to better distinguish suspicious nodules from other tissues compared with direct backpropagation from the decoder. Experimental results show that this co-training yields better performance on both tasks. The framework is validated on the LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets and a pseudo-label approach is proposed for addressing the label uncertainty problem due to inconsistent annotations/labels. Experimental results show that the proposed nodule detector outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and yields comparable performance as state-of-the-art nodule classification algorithms when classification alone is considered.

The performance of LDDNet is tested on the public lung database LIDC-IDRI which contains many cases of interference for segmentation. Secondly, the labeled with blood vessels and small voids are not contained by the public ground-truth masks of the LIDC-IDRI database, therefore these regions are labeled by us with LabelMe software. Thirdly, for the aim of exploring the effect of image preprocessing on segmenting lung CT images with deep neural network, contrast enhancing, median filtering and Laplacian filtering are used to preprocess the image as comparative experiments. Finally, dataset is classified into four classes by the geometrical shapes to test the performance of LDDNet. The accuracy of the segmentation experiment reaches over 99% and the four classes can all reach over 95%.

To address the thorn problems on low detection sensitivity and high false-positive rate caused by heterogeneity and morphological complexity of 3-D nodule features, a computer-aided detection system is developed to increase the detection sensitivity and classification accuracy of pulmonary nodules. The contributions include: (1) Nodule candidate detection: 3-D Residual U-Net model is improved to detect candidate nodules, which constructs 3-D context-guided module to extract local and global nodule features by setting the dilated convolution with different dilation rates. Furthermore, channel attention mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the channel features, which enhances the generalization and expression ability of the detection-network to effectively learn 3-D spatial context features.

Moreover, each branch deals with the feature map at corresponding depth layers, and then all branchesâ€™ feature maps are combined together to perform nodule classification task.

Attention-Guided Feature Extraction and Multiscale Feature Fusion 3D ResNet for Automated Pulmonary Nodule Detection,G. Zhang; H. Zhang; Y. Yao; Q. Shen,"Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China; Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China; Hainan Normal University, Hainan, China; Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China",IEEE Access,15-Jun-22,2022,10,,61530,61543,"Automatic detection of pulmonary nodules is critical for the early diagnosis and prevention of lung cancer. Computed tomography (CT) is an effective and economical lung cancer detection method. In CT images, the size and shape of pulmonary nodules appear different, and some nodules appear similar to the surrounding tissues. Therefore, the automatic localization of pulmonary nodules in CT images is a challenging task. An attention-embedded three-dimensional convolutional neural network is proposed for pulmonary nodule detection in the current study. Specifically, 1) channel-spatial attention guides 3D ResNet to down sample the input 3D CT patch. The channel pays attention to important features and the space to the region of interest. The two form a complementary feature extraction mechanism to effectively help the global flow of information in the network and refine the feature mapping to extract the nodule context features. 2) The channel-spatial attention module changes the fusion model of the feature pyramid, adaptively adjusts the pixel-level weight between features and extracts multi-scale representative node features. 3) The deep separable convolution is used to replace the standard convolution of ResNet, reducing the time cost and improving the efficiency of model training on the premise of ensuring the modelâ€™s performance. 4) To adapt the distribution of nodule scale, different characteristic layers correspond to two sizes of anchors. Under the condition of ensuring the detection rate of nodules, the number of anchor frames is reduced, and the network sensitivity is improved. Finally, several ablation experiments are carried out using the LUNA16 dataset. The results revealed that the attention-guided network could extract the multi-scale representative features of nodules, and the average sensitivity was 97.7%. Additionally, the CMP score reached 0.912.

This paper proposes a comprehensive and comparative global and local feature extraction framework for lung cancer detection using CT scan images. This framework consists of three main phases: data collection, global training and testing, and local training and testing. A set of 1000 CT scan images is used in this study. During the global training and testing phase, the collected images are preprocessed through image warping and cropping. Global features are then extracted from images to represent each image with feature vectors, using ten different image feature types. The feature vectors are then used to build detection models with six different machine learning algorithms. In the local training and testing phase, each image is divided into a set of local blocks. Those feature types that performed well in the global phase are then extracted from each of these blocks, to represent each block with feature vectors. These feature vectors are then used to build detection models for all of the image blocks, using the learning algorithms that performed well in the global phase. The results show that the Gabor Filter, the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and the Haar Wavelet feature types outperformed the other seven feature types. The results also show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms the other five learning algorithms. Of most importance, the proposed local feature extraction approach outperforms the traditional global one. In the local phase, using SVM with Haar Wavelet features achieved 90% accuracy, 88% sensitivity, and 91% specificity. Using SVM with HOG features achieved 88% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, and 89% specificity.

However, because the number of lung CT images in current dataset is relatively small and the ratio of nodule samples to non-nodule samples is usually very different, this makes the training of neural networks difficult and poor performance of neural networks. Hence, LDNNET is proposed, which adopts Dense-Block, batch normalization (BN) and dropout to cope with these problems. Meanwhile, LDNNET is an adaptive architecture based on convnets combining softmax classifier which is utilized to alleviate the problems of training deep convnets. Follows are our main work: Firstly, we utilized LDNNET on database LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) for lung nodule classification and database KAGGLE DATA-SCIENCE-BOWL-2017(Kaggle DSB 2017) for lung cancer classification; Secondly, the comparison experiments are designed to compare the performance of dense connection, pooling layer and the input pixel size of lung CT(Computed Tomography) images; Thirdly, data enhancement, dense connection and dropout layer were utilized in LDNNET to reduce overfitting; Fourthly, pre-processing methods, for instance enhanced contrast, median filtering, Laplacian filtering are compared to the no-processing method to explore the effect of pre-processing on lung CT images classification. Fifthly, accuracy, specificity and sensitivity on LUNA16 are 0.988396, 0.994585 and 0.982072 and these indicators on Kaggle DSB 2017 are 0.999480, 0.999652 and 0.998974. Furthermore, AUC for both two datasets is over 0.98. Consequently, this paper conducts experiments with uniform parameter settings on two publicly available databases and shows that even in challenging situation where lung images are directly utilized as input images without preprocessing, LDNNET is still the more advanced algorithm than other recent algorithms respectively.

In this paper, a multiscale aggregation network (MSANet), which integrates spatial and channel information, is proposed for 3D pulmonary nodule detection. MSANet is designed to improve the network's ability to extract information and realize multiscale information fusion. First, multiscale aggregation interaction strategies are used to extract multilevel features and avoid feature fusion interference caused by large resolution differences. These strategies can effectively integrate the contextual information of adjacent resolutions and help to detect different sized nodules. Second, the feature extraction module is designed for efficient channel attention and self-calibrated convolutions (ECA-SC) to enhance the interchannel and local spatial information. ECA-SC also recalibrates the features in the feature extraction process, which can realize adaptive learning of feature weights and enhance the information extraction ability of features. Third, the distribution ranking (DR) loss is introduced as the classification loss function to solve the problem of imbalanced data between positive and negative samples. The proposed MSANet is comprehensively compared with other pulmonary nodule detection networks on the LUNA16 dataset, and a CPM score of 0.920 is obtained.

Accurately diagnosing the malignancy of suspected lung nodules is of paramount clinical importance. However, to date, the pathologically-proven lung nodule dataset is largely limited and is highly imbalanced in benign and malignant distributions. In this study, we proposed a Semi-supervised Deep Transfer Learning (SDTL) framework for benign-malignant pulmonary nodule diagnosis. First, we utilize a transfer learning strategy by adopting a pre-trained classification network that is used to differentiate pulmonary nodules from nodule-like tissues. Second, since the size of samples with pathological-proven is small, an iterated feature-matching-based semi-supervised method is proposed to take advantage of a large available dataset with no pathological results. Specifically, a similarity metric function is adopted in the network semantic representation space for gradually including a small subset of samples with no pathological results to iteratively optimize the classification network. In this study, a total of 3,038 pulmonary nodules (from 2,853 subjects) with pathologically-proven benign or malignant labels and 14,735 unlabeled nodules (from 4,391 subjects) were retrospectively collected. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SDTL framework achieves superior diagnosis performance, with accuracy = 88.3%, AUC = 91.0% in the main dataset, and accuracy = 74.5%, AUC = 79.5% in the independent testing dataset. Furthermore, ablation study shows that the use of transfer learning provides 2% accuracy improvement, and the use of semi-supervised learning further contributes 2.9% accuracy improvement. Results implicate that our proposed classification network could provide an effective diagnostic tool for suspected lung nodules, and might have a promising application in clinical practice.",1558-254X,,10.1109/TMI.2021.3123572,National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0116400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91859203); Sichuan International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation/ HongKong-Macao-Taiwan Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project(grant numbers:2018HH0161); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591607,Pulmonary nodule;deep learning;transfer learning;semi-supervised learning;benign-malignant classification,Lung;Computed tomography;Lung cancer;Tumors;Transfer learning;Semisupervised learning;Medical diagnostic imaging,cancer;computerised tomography;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;lung;medical image processing;semi-supervised learning (artificial intelligence);tumours,pulmonary nodules;SDTL framework;independent testing dataset;suspected lung nodules;semisupervised deep transfer learning;benign-malignant diagnosis;chest CT;lung cancer;cancer deaths;paramount clinical importance;pathologically-proven lung nodule dataset;benign distributions;malignant distributions;benign-malignant pulmonary nodule diagnosis;transfer learning strategy;pre-trained classification network;differentiate pulmonary nodules;nodule-like tissues;iterated feature-matching-based semisupervised method;network semantic representation space,"Humans;Lung Neoplasms;Retrospective Studies;Solitary Pulmonary Nodule;Supervised Machine Learning;Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,33,IEEE,27-Oct-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
